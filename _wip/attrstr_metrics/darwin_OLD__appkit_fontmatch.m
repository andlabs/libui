// Stupidity: Core Text requires an **exact match for the entire traits dictionary**, otherwise it will **drop ALL the traits**.
// This seems to be true for every function in Core Text that advertises that it performs font matching; I can confirm at the time of writing this is the case for
// - CTFontDescriptorCreateMatchingFontDescriptors() (though the conditions here seem odd)
// - CTFontCreateWithFontDescriptor()
// - CTFontCreateCopyWithAttributes()
// And as a bonus prize, this also applies to Cocoa's NSFontDescriptor methods as well!
// We have to implement the closest match ourselves.
// This needs to be done early in the matching process; in particular, we have to do this before adding any features (such as small caps), because the matching descriptors won't have those.

// Italics are hard because Core Text does NOT distinguish between italic and oblique.
// All Core Text provides is a slant value and the italic bit of the symbolic traits mask.
// However, Core Text does seem to guarantee (from experimentation; see below) that the slant will be nonzero if and only if the italic bit is set, so we don't need to use the slant value.
// Core Text also seems to guarantee that if a font lists itself as Italic or Oblique by name (font subfamily name, font style name, whatever), it will also have that bit set, so testing this bit does cover all fonts that name themselves as Italic and Oblique. (Again, this is from the below experimentation.)
// TODO there is still one catch that might matter from a user's POV: the reverse is not true â€” the italic bit can be set even if the style of the font face/subfamily/style isn't named as Italic (for example, script typefaces like Adobe's Palace Script MT Std); I don't know what to do about this...
