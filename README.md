# libui: a portable GUI library for C

This README is being written.<br>
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andlabs/libui.png)](https://travis-ci.org/andlabs/libui)

## Runtime Requirements

* Windows: Windows Vista SP2 with Platform Update or newer
* Unix: GTK+ 3.4 or newer
* Mac OS X: OS X 10.7 or newer

## Build Requirements

* All platforms:
	* GNU make 3.81 or newer (Xcode comes with this; on Windows you will need to get it yourself)
* Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or newer
	* This may be reduced to 2010 if necessary.
	* MinGW is currently unsupported. MinGW-w64 support will be re-added once the following features come in:
		* [Isolation awareness](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375197%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
		* Linker symbols for some functions such as `TaskDialog()` (which I thought I submitted...)
* Unix: nothing specific
* Mac OS X: nothing specific, so long as you can build Cocoa programs

(TODO write some notes on make variables and cross-compiling)

## Documentation

Needs to be written. Consult ui.h and the examples for details for now.
